Face Recognition using InsightFace
1. Introduction
This project aims to explore and implement a one-shot face recognition system using a state of the art deep learning model to identify the actor Ryan Gosling from group images. We will go over every process and model used to try and achieve this, the logic behind how those models work, and how our newly trained model performs after applying transfer learning.
2. Objectives
● Program a one-shot face recognition model by leveraging transfer learning.
● Evaluate different models and select the best one for our use case.
● Train the selected model with additional images to see if accuracy improves.
● Provide performance measurements to assess the accuracy of our model.
